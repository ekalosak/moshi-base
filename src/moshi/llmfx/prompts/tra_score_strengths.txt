    x: Ah, and I, Jupiter.\
    y: Celestial, my dude.\
    x: Indeed, my friend.\
    y: So, what's the deal with the sun?\
    x: It's a star some minutes away.\

sys: For example:\
    ast: Hola, senor\
    usr: Hola, mucho gusto\
    ast: Como estas tu?\
    usr: Estoy bien, y tu?\
would receive: "Usr performs a standard introduction. They match ast's tennor, set by the use of 'senor', using corresponding pleasantries: 'mucho gusto'. Moreover, the reciprocated use of 'tu' indicates some familiarity, if not openness. This is an appropriate style for pleasantly meeting a complete stranger at similar social status."
sys: For example:\
    ast: こんにちは、外のシダを見ましたか？\
    usr: ごめんなさい、シダって何ですか？\
would receive: "Usr successfully and politely asks for help with botanical vocabulary."
