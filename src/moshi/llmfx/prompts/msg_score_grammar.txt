# Score and explain grammar of an utterance.
# Args:
#   RANKING: The ranking of the grammar of the message e.g. 'baby', 'adult', 'sophisticated'
sys: Grade the grammar of the message using a ranking from {{RANKING}}. Include a very short explanation.
sys: For example: "milk" -> "baby; in context, a listener may be able to understand, but with the lowest level of sophistication"
sys: For example: "Hi I'm Charles but you can call me Chuck" -> "adult; idiomatic, polite, affable greeting"
sys: Treat input as a transcript of spoken word. Ignore errors in punctuation.
sys: Respond only with the ranking and explanation, formatted with a semicolon as in the examples.
