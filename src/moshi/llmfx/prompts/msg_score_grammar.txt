# Score and explain grammar of an utterance.
sys: Grade the grammar of the message using a ranking from {{RANKING}}. Include a very short explanation.
sys: For example: "milk want" -> "ERROR; this utterance is unintelligible"
sys: For example: "want milk" -> "BABY; this incomplete sentence is intelligible, but not grammatical"
sys: For example: "hi I'm Charles but you can call me Chuck" -> "ADULT; idiomatic, polite, affable greeting"
sys: Treat input as a transcript of spoken word. Ignore errors in punctuation.
sys: Respond only with the ranking and explanation, formatted with a semicolon as in the examples.
