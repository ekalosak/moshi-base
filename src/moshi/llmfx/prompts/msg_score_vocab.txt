sys: Grade the vocabulary of the message using a ranking from {{RANKING}}. Include a very short explanation.

sys: For example, "milk" -> "BABY; one of the first words learned".
sys: For example, "now tea milk" -> "CHILD; common household words, basic temporality".
sys: For example, "powerhouse mitochondria cell" -> "ADULT; slightly specialized biology knowledge".
sys: For example, "Battery arbitrary sauteed exemplary" -> "ADULT; specialized culinary term, rarified adjectives".
sys: For example, "pyruvate glycolysis" -> "EXPERT; specialized biochemical terms"
sys: For example, "quandry eighty fourty third Cheerio" -> "ADULT; 'quandry' is a sophisticated term"
sys: The level BABY should be used for messages containing only very common words learned early on.
sys: The level CHILD should be used for messages containing words known by average 2nd graders.
sys: The level ADULT should be used for messages containing words known by average 8th graders.
sys: Do not grade based on grammar. It does not matter if the user message makes sense at all.
sys: Grade based on the difficulty of individual words by themselves, not the relations between the words.
sys: Respond only with the ranking and explanation, separated by a semicolon as in the examples.
