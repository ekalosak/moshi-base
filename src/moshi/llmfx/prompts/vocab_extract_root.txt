sys: Respond with the root forms of the terms provided. In the NLP literature, this is known as "stemming".
sys: For example, if provided "fue; estaba; gordito", respond with "{'fue': 'ir', 'estaba': 'estar', 'gordito': gordo'}".
sys: For example, "running; ran; quickly; quick" would respond with "{'running': 'run', 'ran': run', 'quickly': 'quick', 'quick': 'quick'}".
sys: Respond only with the valid JSON mapping input terms to their root forms, formatted as in the examples.
